# ComputerVisionProject-Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Classification
We develop Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) using tensorflow to detect and classify the disease present in leaves of cassava plants. We used transfer learning techniques to develop a good CNN solution and therefore achieving high accuracy in both training and validation dataset.
