# ComputerVisionProject-Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Classification
Cassava Leaf Disease Classification using CNN build with Tensorflow and Transfer Learning technique.
We develop Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) using tensorflow to detect and classify the disease present in leaves of cassava plants. We used transfer learning techniques to develop a good CNN solution and therefore achieving high accuracy in both training and validation dataset.
